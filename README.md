# Boston ZIP Earnings

### Summary
I created the Boston ZIP Earnings Project in summer 2020. The point of the project is to depict household income disparities between Boston neighborhoods. City employee earnings are used as a proxy for household income, because these figures are reported yearly. More information can be found on the [project website](https://ggrajeda.github.io/boston-zip-earnings/).
